## Hi there!

I'm a Senior Software Engineer currently working at [SAP](https://sap.com). I hold a degree in Information Systems from [Unisinos](https://unisinos.br/).

I'm interested in various topics, including:
- Algorithms and data structures;
- Cloud computing and distributed systems;
- Functional programming;

Fun facts:
- Father of a stubborn Bulldog who thinks he’s the boss;
- Always available for a cup of ☕️, 🍻 or 🧉;
- Die-hard fan of [S.C. Internacional](https://internacional.com.br/).
